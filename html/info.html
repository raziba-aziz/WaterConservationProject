    <h2>Information on importance of water conservation</h2>
    <h3>Why Conserve Water?</h3>
    <p>Water is one of the most precious resources on our planet. Though about 71% of Earth is covered in water, only 3% of it is freshwater, and even less is readily accessible for human consumption. With climate change, population growth, and increased demand for clean water, conservation has become more critical than ever. Without conscious efforts to save water, we risk facing severe droughts, reduced agricultural productivity, and damage to ecosystems.</p>
    <p>By conserving water, we ensure a sustainable future, protect aquatic habitats, and reduce energy consumption associated with water treatment and distribution. Every drop saved contributes to a healthier planet!</p>

    <h3>How to Conserve?</h3>

    <h4>At Home:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Turn off taps while brushing</b> – A running tap can waste up to 4 liters of water per minute.</li>
        <li><b>Fix leaks promptly</b> – A single dripping faucet can waste thousands of liters of water annually.</li>
        <li><b>Use water-efficient appliances</b> – Installing low-flow showerheads, faucets, and dual-flush toilets can drastically cut water usage.</li>
        <li><b>Opt for bucket washes</b> – Instead of long showers or running hoses, using a bucket can save dozens of liters of water per wash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>In the Garden:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Water plants in the morning or evening</b> – This prevents evaporation loss during the hot part of the day.</li>
        <li><b>Use drip irrigation</b> – It delivers water directly to plant roots, minimizing wastage.</li>
        <li><b>Choose drought-resistant plants</b> – Native plants require less water and are well-adapted to the climate.</li>
        <li><b>Collect rainwater</b> – A rain barrel can provide free water for gardening, reducing dependence on groundwater.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>In the Community:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Raise awareness</b> – Educate friends and family about the importance of conservation.</li>
        <li><b>Report leaks</b> – Public infrastructure leaks waste millions of liters annually. Reporting them helps save water.</li>
        <li><b>Participate in conservation events</b> – Joining local cleanup and tree-planting initiatives promotes sustainability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of Not Conserving Water</h3>
    <p>Failing to conserve water can lead to devastating consequences, affecting both humans and nature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Water Shortages</b> – Scarcity can lead to increased water prices, making it inaccessible to many.</li>
        <li><b>Environmental Damage</b> – Rivers, lakes, and wetlands dry up, endangering wildlife.</li>
        <li><b>Food Production Decline</b> – Agriculture is highly dependent on water, and shortages can lead to food insecurity.</li>
        <li><b>Health Risks</b> – Lack of clean water contributes to the spread of diseases and poor sanitation.</li>
    </ul>

                <h3>Fact 1</h3>
                <p>A 10-minute shower uses around 25 gallons of water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact-card">
                <h3>Fact 2</h3>
                <p>Fixing a leaky faucet can save up to 3,000 gallons of water per year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact-card">
                <h3>Fact 3</h3>
                <p>By 2025, half of the world’s population may face water scarcity.</p>

    <h3>Innovative Water Conservation Technologies</h3>
    <p>Technology plays a vital role in water conservation. Some cutting-edge solutions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Smart Irrigation Systems</b> – Sensors optimize watering based on weather conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Greywater Recycling</b> – Systems that reuse water from sinks and showers for flushing and irrigation.</li>
        <li><b>Desalination Plants</b> – Extracting freshwater from seawater to reduce dependency on groundwater.</li>
        <li><b>AI-Based Water Monitoring</b> – Smart meters track water consumption and detect leaks instantly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Water conservation is not just a responsibility—it’s a necessity for sustaining life. Whether at home, in the community, or through technological advancements, every action counts. By making small but impactful changes, we can ensure that future generations inherit a world where clean water is abundant. Let’s act today to preserve water for tomorrow!</p>
